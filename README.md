# ML-DL-Decision-Support-System-for-Vehicle-Pricing-and-Sales-Forecasting

This project is a decision support system for vehicle pricing and sales forecasting, utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques. The system provides various functionalities such as extracting information about motorcycles and electric vehicles, predicting sell/buy prices, and forecasting annual sales.

## Functionalities

1. **Motorcycle Information**: Extracts information about motorcycles based on the user's preferred company and model name.
2. **Electric Vehicle Information**: Provides information about electric vehicles based on user preferences.
3. **Sell/Buy Price Prediction**: Predicts the second-hand price of vehicles ranging from maximum to minimum based on user-entered vehicle information.
4. **Annual Sales Forecast**: Utilizes time series forecasting algorithms such as LSTM, RNN, and GRU to predict future sales market trends for different companies.
5. **Exit**: Exit the program.

## Recommendation System

The system includes a recommendation system that suggests options to the user based on their choices and preferences, guiding them through the decision-making process effectively.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

- **Sell/Buy Price Prediction**:
  - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
  - Linear Regression
  - k-Nearest Neighbors Regressor (KNR)
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Decision Tree
  - Voting Regressor

## Deep Learning Algorithms

- **Annual Sales Forecast**:
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
  - Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of four datasets personally curated by referencing official websites, blogs, second-hand showrooms, and experienced mechanics. These datasets contain information relevant to vehicle pricing, specifications, market trends, and sales history.
